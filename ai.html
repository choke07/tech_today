                What exactly does the term ‘Metaverse’ mean? Will it revolutionise our daily lives? What does it comprise? How does it relate to the world of education? Just some of the questions that you may be asking yourself because, for many of us, the idea of a Metaverse is still a bit like science fiction. This article aims to provide answers and explanations !

                <h3>Metaverse: What does it actually mean?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                Ever since Facebook decided to rename its platform Meta, the Metaverse has been gaining prominence and so you’ve probably already heard of it. But, what’s behind the word? The Metaverse is a contraction of the words ‘meta’ and ‘universe’ and simply means ‘virtual universe’. Often confused with the world of video games, the Metaverse offers many more possibilities. It is a shared, immersive, three-dimensional virtual place in which people can interact, discuss, play, and even learn, using digital tools. Seen by some as the successor to the internet, the Metaverse uses existing technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, video games, and artificial intelligence. This world therefore makes it possible to combine immersion and collaborative work. This is why some users today consider the virtual world as an extension of their real life.

Increasingly used by young people, the Metaverse is a network of interconnected experiences, applications, digital tools, and infrastructures that offer users three main features: the feeling of immersion, real-time interactivity and infinite use.

                <h3>What are the origins of the Metaverse ?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                In fact, the Metaverse is not a new thing. Virtual worlds have been around longer than you might think. In 1992, the American novelist, Neal Stephenson, coined the term Metaverse when he published his book The Virtual Samurai. In it, he describes a parallel world, accessible through a headset where it is possible to move around virtually and interact with objects.

                In 2003, the game Second Life featured this virtual universe. Then, the films The Matrix and Wreck-It Ralph introduced the concept of a virtual world to a wider audience. Today, it is Facebook that has changed its name and called its platform Meta.
