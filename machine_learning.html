                <h3>Intelligent Gesture Recognition Techniques</h3>

                    <b>Gesture recognition</b> is an ideal means of interaction because it allows users not to have to make contact with any surface, which is a safe and hygienic means, especially in the pandemic situation that is occurring worldwide. However, gesture recognition is not a new discipline and it has been researched for many years but this type of interaction has not succeeded in replacing the keyboard and mouse. It is very useful to know about the advances that are being made with artificial intelligence in gesture recognition to be able to perform a more robust and reliable gesture recognition with a low response time. As it is, deep learning is being integrated into various areas to increase improvement in performance and one such area is artificial intelligence.

                     In this way, there is the possibility that in the future the recognition of gestures will be a viable option as a means of daily interaction for the user and the main objective of this paper is to contribute to that process. For this reason, this study has analyzed 571 papers related to gesture recognition and artificial intelligence. This analysis has extracted relevant information related to scientific production, such as the most productive authors and journals or the most pertinent articles on the subject. Furthermore, we have developed our own model, which shows the relationship between the types of gesture recognition and the artificial intelligence techniques that have been applied for this task.

                    However, gesture recognition is not a strange or even novel technique for users due to the day-to-day use of mobiles. Mobile phones are used to check mail, surf the internet, interact with social networks, take photos and even play games. These mobile devices have become a fundamental part of usersâ€™ lives because it is capable of executing all the tasks that can be carried out with a computer but with very small dimensions so they can be with the users 24 hours a day regardless of their locations or circumstances.

                    The most relevant thing is that these tools are handled with gesture recognition. From tapping the device to opening an application to dragging their finger to reduce the size of an image or change the screen, all these movements are gestures that people make daily several times a day. Furthermore, these devices are not only used by adults, but the immersion of these tools in the daily routine has also enabled children to use them at an early age and to perform the gestures that involve the use of these devices in a natural and intuitive way
