                <b>A digital notebook</b> is a sleek tech device designed to replace typical paper writing pads. Using specially designed pens, you can write or draw directly on the screen or surface of your new digital notebook and have your notes uploaded to the cloud. Some digital notepads let you use a stylus or smart pen on any digital notebook surface, but certain brands have developed their own pen technology that will only work with their devices. So, what makes a digital notebook different from a tablet, e-reader or drawing tablet? While you can also use a stylus to write on those devices, digital notebooks prioritize the writing process with paper-like displays, organizational templates and effortless document signing. And while some digital notebooks may have access to web browsing and applications, that’s not true for all brands and models, so make sure to seek out one with the features that are most important to you.

                <h3>How to use a digital notebook.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                <b>How you use a digital notebook</b> depends on the style you choose. Some notebooks are a single digital screen (similar to a tablet) with note-taking applications for various writing needs. But you can also find digital notepads that look just like a spiral-bound notebook — except they’re filled with tech-infused, reusable pages. Digital notebooks with paperless pages are designed to give you the look and feel of a paper notebook without all the waste. These notebooks can also connect to the cloud or your favorite storage platform so you can save your work as a document that can be shared with others. Once you’re done with a note or project, just wipe the page clean and start again. Keep in mind that some digital notebooks require water to clean the ink off of the synthetic pages, so make sure you read the manual for whichever design you choose. Unlike a paper notebook, you’ll never reach the last page with a digital notepad, so you can save money and live more sustainably.

                <b>And if you decide to go</b> with an e ink notebook with a screen, there are several other things you can do on your device. Most digital notebooks come with document-signing software that lets you sign with your stylus, just as you would a pen. You can also find models that connect to your smartphone so you can view an app on a larger screen. And some digital notebooks offer capabilities for graphic design, sketching and photo editing.

                <h3>What is the best digital notebook for you?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
Once you’ve decided if you want a screen or synthetic pages, there are a few other details to consider when shopping for a digital notebook. In the past, when you shopped for paper notebooks, you most likely considered size. And this detail is still important when buying a digital notebook. Depending on your needs, you may want a full composition-size digital notebook with plenty of space for lecture notes or diagrams. Or you may be looking for a smaller pocket digital notebook for quick thoughts and memos. If you’re choosing a digital notebook with a screen, you’ll also want to take its pixel resolution into consideration to ensure your image is as clear and vibrant as you would like it to be.
