                <b>Now that a large percentage of the workforce</b> is working from home as a result of the pandemic, how can employers and line managers ensure effective performance management in remote or hybrid teams? From performance appraisals to meetings with an underperforming individual, read on for our Top Ten Tips for managing performance in virtual teams. In hybrid teams, it’s not just poor performance that you should be on the lookout for. You may find that some team members are thriving in their new environment or are going above and beyond for your company in these difficult times. Make time to celebrate their successes and provide recognition for great performance. A thank you can go a long way to making staff feel valued and motivated! It’s important for everyone’s sake that you understand you can’t monitor every aspect of your team’s work – and you shouldn’t need to! If you’re lucky enough to have experienced employees in your team then they don’t want to feel as if they are being micromanaged and aren’t trusted to do their jobs. Get comfortable with trusting, rather than observing and implement different ways to monitor and measure performance.

                <b>If most team members</b> are working from home then there will be even less opportunity for water-cooler conversations and informal catch-ups in the canteen. Therefore, it’s important to set aside time to regularly touch base with your employees, whether discussing performance or not. This gives you a valuable opportunity to check in with your team, are they coping with their at-home environment? Do they have everything they need to work effectively? This will also help you deliver any feedback in a timely manner.
